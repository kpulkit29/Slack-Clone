# pusher-platform-node

Pusher Platform SDK for Node.js.

## Installation

Add `pusher-platform-node` to your package.json file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "pusher-platform-node": "~0.13.0"
  }
}
```

## Usage

In order to access Pusher Platform, first instantiate an Instance object.
It takes the following arguments:

```js
var pusher = require("pusher-platform-node");

var pusherPlatform = new pusher.Instance({
  locator: '',
  serviceName: '',
  serviceVersion: '',
  key: '',
});
```

`locator` is unique to an app developers' instance - they get that from the dashboard. The service SDKs will need to relay that down. Same for the `key`.
`serviceName` and `serviceVersion` should come from the service SDK itself. They can be hardcoded there. Think `feeds` and `v1`.

It is also possible to specify `host` and `port`. This will override the cluster value that is encoded in the `instance` and allow you to connect to a development or testing server.

### Authentication

Instance objects provide an `authenticate` method, which can be used in controllers
to build authentication endpoints. Authentication endpoints issue access tokens
used by Pusher Platform clients to access the API.

Calling `authenticate` will return an object that has the following shape:

```js
{
  access_token: 'adsasd',
  token_type: 'bearer',
  expires_in: 86400
}
```

If you want to have a refresh token returned as well, then you need to call
`authenticateWithRefreshToken`. That will return an object with the following shape:

```js
{
  access_token: 'adsasd',
  token_type: 'bearer',
  expires_in: 86400,
  refresh_token: 'cxacsac'
}
```

Make sure you authenticate the user before issuing access tokens.

- `authenticatePayload` param is essentially object of type `AuthenticatePayload`. The object must have the following format: (please note that if you using one of our client libraries they will handle this format for you)

```js
type AuthenticatePayload {
  grant_type: string;
  refresh_token?: string;
};
```

```js
let authenticatePayload = {
  grant_type: 'client_credentials'
};

let authOptions = {
  userId: 'zan',
  serviceClaims: {
    claim1: 'sdsdsd'
    ...
  }
};

let authResponse = app.authenticate(authenticatePayload, authOptions);
```

Where the authResponse is an object containing your access token (and refresh token, if you called `authenticateWithRefreshToken`):

```js
let = authResponse: {
  access_token: 'adsasd',
  token_type: 'bearer',
  expires_in: 86400,
}
```

A custom token expiry value can be set by including a `tokenExpiry` key in the `authOptions` object.

```
let authOptions = {
  userId: 'zan',
  serviceClaims: {
    claim1: 'sdsdsd'
    ...
  }
  tokenExpiry: (10 * 60),
};
```

### Request API

Instance objects provide a low-level request API, which can be used to contact services running on the Pusher Platform.

```js
pusherApp.request({
  method: "POST",
  path: 'feeds/playground',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: { items: ['test'] },
}).then(function(response) {
  console.log(response.statusCode);
  console.log(response.headers);
  return pusher.readJSON(response);
}).then(function(body) {
  console.log(body);
}).catch(function(e) {
  if (e instanceof pusher.ErrorResponse) {
    console.log(e.status);
    console.log(e.headers);
    console.log(e.error);
    console.log(e.error_description);
    console.log(e.error_uri);
  } else {
    console.log(e);
  }
});
```
