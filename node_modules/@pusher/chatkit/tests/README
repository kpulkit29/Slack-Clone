Configure

  Copy config/example.js to config/production.js, config/staging.js, and
  config/development.js. Fill in instance credentials for each.

  Set the test context with

  $ yarn test-context production|staging|development

Run

  $ yarn test

  or for raw output (including logs)

  $ yarn test:raw

WARNING

  The tests completely wipe the instance on teardown -- so obviously don't do
  this with an instance you're using for anything else!
